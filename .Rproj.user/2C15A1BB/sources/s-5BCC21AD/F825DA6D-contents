# Welcome {-}
This is the online home of *Geocomputation with R*, a book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.

**Note**: The first edition of the book has been published by CRC Press in the [R Series](https://www.routledge.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).
You can buy the book from [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/9781138304512), or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Geocomputation-R-Robin-Lovelace-dp-0367670577/dp/0367670577/), and see the archived **First Edition** hosted on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/). 
Inspired by the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial ([FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/)) movement, the code and prose underlying this book are open, ensuring that the content is reproducible, transparent, and accessible.
Hosting the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/) allows anyone to interact with the project by opening issues or contributing new content and typo fixes for the benefit of everyone.

# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
